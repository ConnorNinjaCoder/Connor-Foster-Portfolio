      <h2>Hi! I'm Connor Foster</h2>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I graduated from The Ohio State University in May of 2020 with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. After graduation, I decided my passion was in the field of software engineering, so now I'm transitioning with the help of Thinkful Engineering Flex program!</p>
      <p> Outside of Software Development, I enjoy walking my dog, playing video games, and hanging out with family/friends. On saturdays during football season, you're likely to find me slouched on the couch and glued to the television for the majority of the day. </p>
